WindowDressing
==============

Adds open projects and next/previous project window actions to the Window menu for easy switching
between projects. A must-have on Mac OS X and pretty useful on other platforms too.

Restores size and position of project windows on reopening the projects.

See the [plugin page](http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?id=998) on the JetBrains Plugin Repository.

This plugin will receive no further development since its features are now built in (what will be) the
next version of IntelliJ IDEA. Thank you for your interest.
